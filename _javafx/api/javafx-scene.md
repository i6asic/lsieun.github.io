## root node

Any node that inherits from the `javafx.scene.Parent` class can be used as the root node for a scene.
Several nodes, known as layout panes or containers such as `VBox`, `HBox`, `Pane`, `FlowPane`, `GridPane`, or `TilePane`,
can be used as a root node.
`Group` is a special container that groups its children together.
