The first version of MATLAB goes back to the 70s, it was designed as a support tool for
the **Theory of Matrices, Linear Algebra and Numerical Analysis** courses
by the mathematician Cleve Moler.
The name is an acronym: "**MAT**rix **LAB**oratory".
It is mathematical software that offers an Integrated Development Environment
with its own programming language (M language)
that allows for the performing of operations with vectors, matrices and functions,
lambda calculus and programming oriented towards objects,
as well as communication with programs written in other languages and with other hardware devices.

Moreover, it has "Simulink" and "Guide",
two additional tools that further increase the number of features found in MATLAB 3.

Originally, it was written in Fortran over the course of several years,
but currently it is written in C by "The Mathworks".
