DITA XML is a powerful technology designed to facilitate text authoring, reuse, and translation,
and it is especially popular in the field of technical writing for user guides and elearning materials.

It's one of the best standards for **structured content** on the market for all kinds of industries.

DITA XML is an open standard to author, edit, organize, and manage content,
which IBM created for internal use, but later donated to
the **Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards**, **OASIS**, in the year 2005.

It's tool independent,
which means if you are just learning DITA,
you need not depend on specific premium tools or DITA editors for writing DITA documentation.
If you have set up [DITA-OT][dita-ot-url] libraries on your computer,
you can create DITA models and files on a basic text editor (such as Notepad++ or EmEditor),
and use the command line to transform the content you wrote into different DITA output formats according to your needs.

Here Are Some Rapid Fire Facts on DITA:

- DITA is built on XML-based mark-up language.
- It allows for topic-based authoring.
- It follows structured authoring concepts.
- It separates **content** from **formatting** via the DITA style guide.
- It ensures minimalism in your original content
  while allowing for the versatility of transformation of the content into different DITA output formats
  and localization in different languages, all without affecting your original content repository.

## What Is Structured Content?

Structured content is text that's written according to a set of rules that tell machines what to do with the content.

HTML, which is used on the web, is a great example of structured content.
It has tags that tell the browser how to display the text.
For example, the HTML tag `<h1>` tells the browser that the text should be a large heading,
and the tag `<p>` tells it that the text should be a paragraph.
DITA has similar tags that tell computers about the content.

## History

After initial development of DITA was complete, IBM donated it as an open source architecture.
It is now maintained by OASIS, where volunteers who are experts in information continue to help it evolve.

- 2001: First introduced internally at IBM.
- 2005: Version 1 released
- 2007: Version 1.1 released
- 2010: Version 1.2 released
- 2014: Version 1.3 released (forthcoming at the time this article was originally published)

## The Problem that DITA Solves

There's no two ways around it—most people are being really dumb with their content and unfortunately,
they don't even realize it.
Writing content in Word, email, PowerPoint, WordPress, HTML, InDesign, FrameMaker, or any other format
is equivalent to writing on stone tablets.
Your content is essentially stuck in that format and dumb as a rock.
Dumb content can't be easily reused or repurposed, and that's inefficient and costly.

DITA is a way of writing and storing your content, so you can manage it like an asset.
It leverages XML (eXtensible Markup Language) to make your content intelligent, versatile, manageable, and portable.

For example, content that is in DITA can be published to (and fully branded) PDF, HTML, RTF, PowerPoint,
and mobile–all without ever copying and pasting anything between files.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
DITA can reduce translation by up to 80%. Consistency, quality, and usability all improve.
Content creation can be shared across dozens of authors.

DITA takes content out of the stone age and into the information age.

## What Kind of Content?

Traditionally, DITA has been used for detailed and complex technical communication content
(manuals, online help, user guides, etc.) but it is quickly spreading to other areas, including:

- training and learning
- marketing
- business writing, such as proposals, whitepapers, articles, or reports
- books of any kind

There's really no limitation on the kind of content—if it's important to your business, then it can benefit from DITA.

## The Purpose of DITA

The knowledge stored in your documentation has value.
And anything that has value to the organization can be treated as an asset.
Creating and then leaving that information inside a Word or PowerPoint file severely limits what you can do with it,
and whatever you can do, you have to use manual, kludgy ways to do it.
Creating documents with traditional tools in static files is an inefficient way of writing,
updating, sharing, and managing your information.
DITA is an overall approach that solves that inefficiency.

DITA positively affects your content in three main ways; it

- streamlines your content creation process
- increases the quality of your content by standardizing it
- allows you to leverage your content in many ways (reusing it, publishing to multiple formats, translating it efficiently)

Although there are many benefits to DITA, it all boils down to one thing:
**being efficient with your content, so you can save time and money.**

## What DITA Is Not

**DITA is not a particular tool**.
Many tools allow you to author in DITA.
In fact, selecting your tool set is part of the process of DITA adoption.

**DITA is not a template**, although authors often use templates to make it even faster and easier to write.

**DITA is not a style guide**, although authors certainly benefit from one, with or without DITA content.

## Why XML?

Don't let the XML part of DITA scare you.
It's just the architecture underneath your content.
Every piece of content gets stored inside tags—titles, paragraphs, ordered lists—
whatever you need to classify your content into a defined set of topic types.
DITA has a set of rules that say what tags are allowed where,
which gives you standardization of your content.

DITA XML ultimately does three things.

**DITA XML organizes your content into topics.**
Not all XML does this, but DITA has a core set of topic types,
so you can put the right sort of information in the right topic type, resulting in highly usable content.
Think of topics and even the XML inside topics like Lego® blocks.
You use them in various ways to build what you need.
In the end, they come together to create more than the individual parts.

**XML separates content from format, making it portable and versatile.**
Your words and your format are no longer combined, which means they can be managed and updated independently.
For example, if your branding changes, and you need to update the font size, color, and style in all your documents,
this is going to be a central, one-time change for any content stored without format (in XML).

**XML allows the content to be transformed into many other formats.**
Most people author in XML and then publish to PDF, HTML, and either mobile or ePub.
It's also possible to publish to places you wouldn't expect, like Open Office, Excel, and PowerPoint. You're limited only by your imagination.
