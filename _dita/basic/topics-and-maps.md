A DITA document is necessarily modular.
The information unit used to compose a DITA document is called a **topic**.
As its name suggests, a topic addresses a single subject.

The overall contents of a DITA document are specified using a **topic map** (also simply called a **map**).
**A map mainly contains a hierarchy of topic references.**

Remember

- It is recommended to have a single topic per XML file.
- The recommended filename extension for **a topic file** is "`.dita`".
- The recommended filename extension for **a map file** is "`.ditamap`".
- Topic and map files may be contained in different directories.
  You are free to organize the contents of these directories as you wish.
