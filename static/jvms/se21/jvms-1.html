<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.1-100"></a>
   The <span class="trademark"> Java </span> programming language is a general-purpose, concurrent, object-oriented language.
   Its syntax is  similar to C and C++, but it omits many of the features that make C and C++ complex, confusing, and unsafe.
   The Java platform was  initially developed to address the problems of building software for networked consumer devices.
   It was designed to support multiple host  architectures and to allow secure delivery of software components.
   To meet these requirements, compiled code had to survive transport across  networks, operate on any client,
   and assure the client that it was safe to run.
</p>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.1-110"></a> The popularization of the World Wide Web made these attributes much more interesting.
   Web  browsers enabled millions of people to surf the Net and access media-rich content in simple ways.
   At last there was a medium where  what you saw and heard was essentially the same
   regardless of the machine you were using and whether it was connected to a fast network  or a slow modem.
</p>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.1-120"></a>
   Web enthusiasts soon discovered that the content supported by the Web's HTML document format was too limited.
   HTML extensions, such as forms, only highlighted those limitations,
   while making it clear that no browser could include all the features users wanted. Extensibility was the answer.
</p>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.1-130"></a>
   The HotJava browser first showcased the interesting properties of the Java programming language  and platform
   by making it possible to embed programs inside HTML pages.
   Programs are transparently downloaded into the browser along  with the HTML pages in which they appear.
   Before being accepted by the browser, programs are carefully checked to make sure they are  safe.
   Like HTML pages, compiled programs are network- and host-independent.
   The programs behave the same way regardless of where  they come from or what kind of machine they are being loaded into and run on.
</p>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.1-140"></a>
   A Web browser incorporating the Java platform is no longer limited to a predetermined set of  capabilities.
   Visitors to Web pages incorporating dynamic content can be assured that their machines cannot be damaged by that  content.
   Programmers can write a program once, and it will run on any machine supplying a Java run-time environment.

<h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="jvms-1.2"></a> 1.2. The Java Virtual Machine </h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.2-100"></a> The Java Virtual Machine is the cornerstone of the Java platform.
   It is the component of the technology  responsible for its hardware- and operating system-independence,
   the small size of its compiled code, and its ability to protect users from  malicious programs.
</p>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.2-110"></a> The Java Virtual Machine is an abstract computing machine.
   Like a real computing machine, it has an  instruction set and manipulates various memory areas at run time.
   It is reasonably common to implement a programming language using a  virtual machine;
   the best-known virtual machine may be the P-Code machine of UCSD Pascal.
</p>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.2-120"></a>
   The first prototype implementation of the Java Virtual Machine, done at Sun Microsystems, Inc., emulated
   the Java Virtual Machine instruction set in software hosted by a handheld device that resembled a contemporary Personal Digital Assistant (PDA).
   Oracle's  current implementations emulate the Java Virtual Machine on mobile, desktop and server devices,
   but the Java Virtual Machine does not assume any particular  implementation technology, host hardware, or host operating system.
   It is not inherently interpreted, but can just as well be implemented by  compiling its instruction set to that of a silicon CPU.
   It may also be implemented in microcode or directly in silicon.
</p>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.2-130"></a> The Java Virtual Machine knows nothing of the Java programming language,
   only of a particular binary format, the <code class="literal"> class </code> file format.
   A <code class="literal"> class </code> file contains Java Virtual Machine instructions
   (or <span class="emphasis"><em> bytecodes </em></span> ) and a symbol table, as well as other ancillary information.
</p>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.2-140"></a>
   For the sake of security, the Java Virtual Machine imposes strong syntactic and structural constraints on the code
   in a <code class="literal"> class </code> file.
   However, any language with functionality that can be expressed in terms of a valid
   <code class="literal"> class </code> file can be hosted by the Java Virtual Machine.
   Attracted by a generally available, machine-independent  platform, implementors of other languages
   can turn to the Java Virtual Machine as a delivery vehicle for their languages.
</p>
<p> The Java Virtual Machine specified here is compatible with the Java SE 21 platform,
   and supports the Java programming language specified in
   <em class="citetitle"> The Java Language Specification, Java SE 21 Edition </em> .

<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.4-100"></a>
   Throughout this specification, we refer to classes and interfaces drawn from the Java SE Platform API.
   Whenever we refer to a class or interface (other than those declared in an example) using a single identifier <code class="varname">N</code>,
   the intended reference is to the class or interface named <code class="varname">N</code> in the package <code class="literal">java.lang</code>.
   We use the fully qualified name for classes or interfaces from packages other than
   <code class="literal">java.lang</code>.
</p>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.4-110"></a> Whenever we refer to a class or interface that is declared in the package <code class="literal"> java </code> or any of its subpackages, the intended reference is to that class or interface as loaded by the bootstrap class loader  ( <a class="xref" href="./jvms-5.html#jvms-5.3.1" title="5.3.1. Loading Using the Bootstrap Class Loader"> 5.3.1 </a> ).
</p>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.4-120"></a> Whenever we refer to a subpackage of a package named <code class="literal"> java </code> , the intended reference is to that subpackage as determined by the bootstrap class  loader.
</p>
<p class="norm"><a id="jvms-1.4-130"></a> A cross-reference within this specification is shown as (x.y). Occasionally, we refer to concepts  in the <em class="citetitle"> The Java Language Specification, Java SE 21 Edition </em> via cross-references of the form (JLS x.y).
