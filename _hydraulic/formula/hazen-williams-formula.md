<p>
A widely used empirical formula to calculate pressure pipe friction for water flowing under turbulent conditions.
It yields results comparable to those for the Darcy–Weisbach formula at moderately high Reynolds numbers.
It expresses flow \(Q\) in a pipe in function of its diameter \(D\), slope \(S_{o}\),
and a friction coefficient \(C\) between 100 and 150 depending on the material and age of the pipe:
</p>

<p>
\[
Q = a \cdot C \cdot D^{2.63} S^{0.54}_{o}
\]
</p>

<p>
with \(a = 0.432\) for <b>English units</b> (cubic feet per second and feet), and
\(a = 0.278\) for <b>metric units</b>  (cubic meters per second and meters).
</p>

<p>
Equivalent formulas for the Hazen–Williams headloss \(h_{f}\)
and average velocity \(V\) are:
</p>

<p>
\[
V = b \cdot C \cdot R^{0.63} S^{0.54}_{o}
\]
</p>

and

<p>
\[
h_{f} = c \cdot V^{1.85} L / (C^{1.85} D^{1.165})
\]
</p>

<p>
with \(b = 1.318\) for English or \(0.849\) for metric units,
\(c = 3.02\) for English or \(6.79\) for metric units,
\(R\) is the hydraulic radius, and \(L\) is the length of the pipe.
</p>

<p>
注：\(h_{f}\)的下标中的 f，应该是指 friction，表示“由摩擦力引起的水头损失”。

Note: Allen Hazen and Gardner Williams developed the formula in 1905.

Other related contributions of Hazen include

- (a) research on water filtration at the Lawrence Experiment Station in Massachusetts,
- (b) extensive work on the theory of sedimentation, and
- (c) development of the principles of probability to determine the safe yield of impounding reservoirs. 

Williams was a professor at the University of Michigan(美国密西根州).
