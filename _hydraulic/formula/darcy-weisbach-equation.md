<p>
A turbulent flow equation established in 1850 on the basis of experiments.
It expresses the energy loss or headloss \(h_{f}\) for flow in pipes as a function of
pipe length \(L\) between two sections, pipe internal diameter \(D\),
the velocity head, and a resistance coefficient or friction factor of the pipe \(f\):
</p>

<p>
\[
h_{f} = f \cdot (L/D) \cdot (V^{2}/2g)
\]
</p>

<p>
注：\(h_{f}\)的下标中的 f，应该是指 friction，表示“由摩擦力引起的水头损失”。
</p>

<p>
where \(V\) is the average velocity, and \(g\) is the gravitational acceleration.
</p>

<p>
Under <b>laminar-flow</b> conditions, the friction factor is:
</p>

<p>
\[
f = 64 / R_{e}
\]
</p>

<p>
where \(R_{e}\) is the Reynolds number.
</p>

<p>
For <b>turbulent flow</b> in smooth pipes and with \(R_{e} > 4000\),
the friction factor may be estimated from
</p>

<p>
\[
\sqrt{f} [log{R_{e} \cdot \sqrt{f}} - 0.8] = 1
\]
