I would take this as my next writing.

pick up

## Code

- code snippet

## 合适

- an **appropriate** runtime exception

## 特殊情况

### corner case

corner case: 极端情况；边界情况

- There is, however, one **corner case** that demands special treatment.
- Static analysis will likely detect hard-to-catch, **corner-case** errors that have the potential to crash your application.

它是什么，而不是什么

- We **spend time and effort focused on** specifying boundary conditions, argument ranges and corner cases **rather than** defining common programming terms, writing conceptual overviews, and including examples for developers. [Link](https://www.oracle.com/de/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html)

- commonly 用的好

Thus, there are **commonly** two different ways to write doc comments -- as API specifications, or as programming guide documentation.

**There is sometimes a discrepancy between** how code should work **and** how it actually works.

我觉得，下面写得非常好

Not a production compression program

The program was specifically designed to serve its primary purpose of education.
No thought or effort was given to speed, efficiency, memory utilization,
or any other factor that would be important in a program written for production data compression purposes.
In some cases, the program was purposely made less efficient (in the name of clarity)
by using two or more statements to accomplish a task that could be accomplished by a single more complex statement.

在下面这段话当中，我想学习的单词是 justification，它表示 reason 的意思，表示：正当理由 a good reason why sth exists or is done

A module's declaration doesn't include a version string.
Addressing the version selection problem wasn't a specific design point for the Java 9 Module System,
so versioning isn't supported.
The **justification** was that this problem is one for build tools and container applications to address.

合作

work hand in glove with 密切合作

Buffers **work hand in glove with** channels.

类比

by the same token 同样地；由于同样原因；由于同样的原因 in a similar way

**By the same token**, if you receive a buffer that was filled elsewhere,
you'll probably need to flip it before retrieving the content.

performance penalty 效能损失；性能代价；性能跌辐

Direct byte buffers are usually the best choice for I/O operations.
By design, they support the most efficient I/O mechanism available to the JVM.
Nondirect byte buffers can be passed to channels,
but doing so may incur a **performance penalty**.

maxim 格言；箴言；座右铭 a well-known phrase
that expresses sth that is usually true or that people think is a rule for sensible behaviour

I recommend the old software **maxim**: first make it work, then make it fast.
Don't worry too much about optimization up front; concentrate first on correctness.
