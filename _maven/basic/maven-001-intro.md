Maven is a build tool.

Maven is a project management tool
that provides build and distribution functionalities, code generation, and communication features.
Above all, Maven provides an advanced dependency management system
that is able to retrieve transitive dependencies and download them from both local and remote repositories.

Maven is built with a plugin-based architecture;
the core architecture provides a set of features that can be extended
through a set of official or custom plugins downloadable from repositories.

Maven comes with the **convention over configuration** philosophy.
The origin of this philosophy resides in the idea
that accepting conventions resulting from a set of past experiences leads to advantages
such as saving time, reuse, and maintenance simplification.
Maven pursues this philosophy through the use of defaults,
which means that unnecessary configurations should be avoided; a project should just work.
