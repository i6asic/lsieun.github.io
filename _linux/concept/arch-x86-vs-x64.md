There is no such thing as `x32`. However, `x86` and `x64` refer to the instruction set architecture of the `CPU`.

## Instruction Set

CPU instruction set architectures are currently in two main categories.

**Complex instruction set** is `x86`, `x64` (also called `x86-64`, `amd64`) two kinds of architecture,
the patent is in the hands of **Intel** and **AMD** two companies,
this architecture CPU is mainly Intel and AMD two companies,
this CPU commonly used in PC machine, including Windows, macOS and Linux.

**Simple instruction set** is an architecture of `arm`,
the patent of which is in the hands of **ARM**,
the main companies of this architecture CPU are Qualcomm, Samsung, Apple, Huawei Hesi, MediaTek and so on.
This CPU is commonly used in cell phones, including Android and Apple.
