At some point, you'll want to include images, downloads, or other digital assets along with your text content.

One common solution is to create a folder in the root of the project directory called something like `assets`,
into which any images, files or other resources are placed.

## Including images and resources

Including an image asset in a post:

```text
... which is shown in the screenshot below:
![My helpful screenshot](/assets/screenshot.jpg)
```

Linking to a PDF for readers to download:

```text
... you can [get the PDF](/assets/mydoc.pdf) directly.
```
