## View post with a future date in Jekyll.

The post's date is in the future. **Future dated posts are not automatically rendered**.

第一种方式：

You can make the post visible by setting `future: true` in `_config.yml`.

第二种方式：

All you have to do is add the `--future` flag.

So in your terminal, do `bundle exec jekyll serve --future` or `jekyll serve --future` depending on which one works for you.
