A **geographic coordinate system (GCS)** uses a three-dimensional spherical surface to define locations on the earth.
**A GCS is often incorrectly called a datum, but a datum is only one part of a GCS.**
A GCS includes an angular unit of measure, a prime meridian, and a datum (based on a spheroid).

```text
GCS = an angular unit of measure + a prime meridian + a datum
```
