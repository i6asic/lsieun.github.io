In the late 1980s, the **International Earth Rotation Service** (**IERS**) introduced
the **International Terrestrial Reference System** (**ITRS**) to support those scientific activities
that require highly accurate positional coordinates;
for example, monitoring crustal motion and the motion of Earth's rotation axis.
The initial realization was called the **International Terrestrial Reference Frame of 1988** (**ITRF88**).
The latest is the **ITRF2005**.
**ITRS** is the first major international reference system to directly address plate tectonics and
other forms of crustal motion by publishing velocities as well as positions for its control points.

The **ITRS** is a **geocentric system**
that the center of mass is defined for the whole Earth, including oceans and atmosphere.
The unit of length is the meter.
The ITRF solutions do not directly use an ellipsoid.
ITRF coordinates are cartesian equatorial coordinates X, Y, and Z.
If needed these coordinates can be transformed to geographical coordinates
(Longitude, Latitude, and Height) referred to an ellipsoid.
