title: "BLH"
sequence: "blh"

why BLH (where `B` is geographical latitude, `L` geographical longitude and `H` is ellipsoidal height) is called `BLH`.

This should be abbreviations for the German words `Breite`（宽度）, `Länge`（长）, `Höhe`（身高）,
which directly translate to `latitude`, `longitude`, `height`.

It is required to clarify: BLH (where: `B` is **geodetic latitude**,
`L` is **geodesic longitude** and `H` is height above the ellipsoid),
and **geographic latitude** is `φ`, **geographic longitude** is `λ`, and for that thanks to the Greeks

As far as I know German cartographers were amongst the first
to define ellipsoids and conduct extensive land surveys.
But I can't give you any sources besides this (only in German available).
