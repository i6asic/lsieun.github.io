If we employ Linear Regression model using, say, the least squares regression method,
the outputs have to be converted to classes, say 0 and 1.
Many Linear Regression algorithms output class and confidence as probability.
As a rule of thumb, if we see that the probabilities of Linear Regression are mostly beyond the ranges of 0.2 to 0.8,
then logistic regression algorithm may be a better choice.
