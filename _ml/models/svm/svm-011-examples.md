SVMs rely on supervised learning methods to classify unknown data into known categories.
These find applications in diverse fields.

Here, we'll look at some of the top real-world examples of SVMs:

## Addressing the geo-sounding problem

The geo-sounding problem is one of the widespread use cases for SVMs,
wherein the process is employed to track the planet's layered structure.
This entails solving the inversion problems
where the observations or results of the issues are used to factor in the variables or parameters that produced them.

In the process, linear function and support vector algorithmic models separate the electromagnetic data.
Moreover, linear programming practices are employed while developing the supervised models in this case.
As the problem size is considerably small, the dimension size is inevitably tiny,
which accounts for mapping the planet's structure.

## Assessing seismic liquefaction potential

Soil liquefaction is a significant concern when events such as earthquakes occur.
Assessing its potential is crucial while designing any civil infrastructure.
SVMs play a key role in determining the occurrence and non-occurrence of such liquefaction aspects.
Technically, SVMs handle two tests: SPT (Standard Penetration Test) and CPT (Cone Penetration Test),
which use field data to adjudicate the seismic status.

Moreover, SVMs are used to develop models that involve multiple variables,
such as soil factors and liquefaction parameters, to determine the ground surface strength.
It is believed that SVMs achieve an accuracy of close to 96-97% for such applications.

## Protein remote homology detection

Protein remote homology is a field of computational biology
where proteins are categorized into structural and functional parameters depending on the sequence of amino acids
when sequence identification is seemingly difficult.
SVMs play a key role in remote homology, with kernel functions determining the commonalities between protein sequences.

Thus, SVMs play a defining role in computational biology.

## Data classification

SVMs are known to solve complex mathematical problems.
However, smooth SVMs are preferred for data classification purposes,
wherein smoothing techniques that reduce the data outliers and make the pattern identifiable are used.

Thus, for optimization problems, smooth SVMs use algorithms such as the Newton-Armijo algorithm
to handle larger datasets that conventional SVMs cannot.
Smooth SVM types typically explore math properties
such as strong convexity for more straightforward data classification, even with non-linear data.

## Facial detection & expression classification

SVMs classify facial structures vs. non-facial ones.
The training data uses two classes of face entity (denoted by +1) and non-face entity (denoted as -1) and
n*n pixels to distinguish between face and non-face structures.
Further, each pixel is analyzed, and the features from each one are extracted that denote face and non-face characters.
Finally, the process creates a square decision boundary around facial structures
based on pixel intensity and classifies the resultant images.

Moreover, SVMs are also used for facial expression classification,
which includes expressions denoted as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and so on.

## Surface texture classification

In the current scenario, SVMs are used for the classification of images of surfaces.
Implying that the images clicked of surfaces can be fed into SVMs
to determine the texture of surfaces in those images and classify them as smooth or gritty surfaces.

## Text categorization & handwriting recognition

Text categorization refers to classifying data into predefined categories.
For example, news articles contain politics, business, the stock market, or sports.
Similarly, one can segregate emails into spam, non-spam, junk, and others.

Technically, each article or document is assigned a score, which is then compared to a predefined threshold value.
The article is classified into its respective category depending on the evaluated score.

For handwriting recognition examples, the dataset containing passages
that different individuals write is supplied to SVMs.
Typically, SVM classifiers are trained with sample data initially and
are later used to classify handwriting based on score values.
Subsequently, SVMs are also used to segregate writings by humans and computers.

## Speech recognition

In speech recognition examples, words from speeches are individually picked and separated.
Further, for each word, certain features and characteristics are extracted.
Feature extraction techniques include Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC),
Linear Prediction Coefficients (LPC), Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (LPCC), and others.

These methods collect audio data, feed it to SVMs and then train the models for speech recognition.

## Stenography detection

With SVMs, you can determine whether any digital image is tampered with, contaminated, or pure.
Such examples are helpful when handling security-related matters for organizations or government agencies,
as it is easier to encrypt and embed data as a watermark in high-resolution images.

Such images contain more pixels; hence, it can be challenging to spot hidden or watermarked messages.
However, one solution is to separate each pixel and store data in different datasets that SVMs can later analyze.

## Cancer detection

Medical professionals, researchers, and scientists worldwide have been toiling hard
to find a solution that can effectively detect cancer in its early stages.
Today, several AI and ML tools are being deployed for the same.
For example, in January 2020, Google developed an AI tool
that helps in early breast cancer detection and reduces false positives and negatives.

In such examples, SVMs can be employed, wherein cancerous images can be supplied as input.
SVM algorithms can analyze them, train the models,
and eventually categorize the images that reveal malign or benign cancer features.
