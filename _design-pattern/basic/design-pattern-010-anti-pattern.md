**Anti-patterns** are certain patterns in software development that are considered bad programming practices.

As opposed to **design patterns** which are common approaches to common problems
which have been formalized and are generally considered a good development practice,
**anti-patterns** are the opposite and are undesirable.

For example, in object-oriented programming, the idea is to separate the software into small pieces called objects.
An anti-pattern in object-oriented programming is a [God object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object)
which performs a lot of functions which would be better separated into different objects.

The bottom line is there are good ways to develop software with commonly used patterns (**design patterns**),
but there are also ways software is developed and implemented which can lead to problems.
Patterns that are considered bad software development practices are **anti-patterns**.
