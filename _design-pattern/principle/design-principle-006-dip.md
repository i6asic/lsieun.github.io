DIP = Dependence Inversion Principle

The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules.
This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.

At the bare bones, the DIP is a simple – yet powerful – programming paradigm
that we can use to implement well-structured, **highly-decoupled**, and reusable software components.
