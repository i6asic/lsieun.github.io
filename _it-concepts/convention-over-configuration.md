**Convention over configuration** is also known as **coding by convention**.



**Convention over configuration** is a design philosophy and technique
that seeks to apply defaults that can be implied from the structure of the code instead of requiring explicit code.
The idea is to simplify development by allowing the developer to worry only about
the unconventional parts of the application and architecture.
