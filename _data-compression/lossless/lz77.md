## Intro

`LZ77` is a lossless data-compression algorithm created by **Abraham Lempel** and **Jacob Ziv** in **1977**.
This algorithm is widely spread in our current systems since, for instance, `ZIP` and `GZIP` are based on `LZ77`.

### A lossless compression algorithm

LZ77 is a lossless compression algorithm.
What this means is that if you compress a document using the algorithm,
and then decompress the compressed version,
the result will be an exact copy of the original document.
Not all compression algorithms are lossless.
The JPEG image compression algorithm, for example,
does not produce an exact copy of an image that has been compressed using the algorithm.

### A dictionary encoding algorithm

LZ77 is known as a **dictionary encoding algorithm**,
as opposed for example to the Huffman encoding algorithm, which is a **statistical encoding algorithm**.
Compression in the LZ77 algorithm is based on the notion
that strings of characters (words, phrases, etc.) occur repeatedly in the message being compressed.
Compression with the Huffman encoding algorithm is based on the probability of occurrence of individual characters in the message.
