title: "What Can Be Done On EPANET"
sequence: "104"
---

Epanet was developed to be a research tool for improving our knowledge of
the movement and fate of drinking water constituents within water distribution networks.

> EPANET 是一个研究供水管网的工具，它可以帮助我们理解水的流动（例如，流量、流速、压力）和水的组成成分（例如，余氯）。

Sampling program design, hydraulic model calibration, chlorine residual analysis,
and total chlorine doses supplied to a water user are among its different uses.

> 几个应用场景

Epanet can also be of help
when evaluating different management strategies
aimed at improving water quality throughout the system, such as:

- Altering source utilization within multiple source systems
- Altering pumping and tank filling/emptying schedules
- Secondary water treatment implantation, such as re-chlorination at storage tanks
- Targeted pipe cleaning and replacement.

Epanet can also be used to improve the hydraulic network characteristics helping in
the design of new elements, the reduction of operational costs, vulnerability studies, bottleneck detection,
water quality and residence time analysis in the pipes,
pressure control, to regulate the use of tanks in order to reduce water residence time,
predicting the network response in supply point closures or
the incorporation of new urbanizations, contingency(意外事故) planning,
as well as the introduction of uncontrolled contaminants,
network sectorization for controlling leaks and better network management, etc.
In the future, models should be used as a continuous support tool
for the technical decision-making in all water utilities.
