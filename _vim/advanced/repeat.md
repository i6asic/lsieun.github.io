title: "repeat"
sequence: "102"

- `.`: (dot) will repeat the last command,
- `N<command>`: will repeat the command N times.

Some examples, open a file and type:

- `2dd` → will delete 2 lines
- `3p` → will paste the text 3 times
- `100idesu [ESC]` → will write “desu desu ...”
- `.` → Just after the last command will write again the 100 “desu”.
- `3.` → Will write 3 “desu” (and not 300, how clever).
