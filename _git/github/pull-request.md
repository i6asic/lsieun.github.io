[UP](/git/git-index.html)


Pull requests are used to request that someone with commit access to the repository
merge the code changes from the pull-request branch into their the main repository.


Once a PR has been received, you can view the changes that have been requested,
and anyone who can view the PR can make comments either inline on the commit or generally on the PR.
If there are comments that require changes to be made,
they can be committed and pushed to the pull-request branch,
and the pull request is updated with these changes.

Once the PR's changes have reached an acceptable standard to be included in the repository,
you can use the Merge button on the GitHub website to merge the requested branch into the repository.
