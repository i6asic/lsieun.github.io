- **Binary compatibility** means that when you change your class, you do not need to recompile classes that use it.
- **Garbage collection** is the process of automatically freeing objects that are no longer referenced by the program.
- **Loading constraints** basically enable the Java virtual machine to enforce **type safety** based not just on **fully qualified name**,
  but also on **the defining class loader**, without forcing eager class loading.
- **Resolution** is the process of locating classes, interfaces, fields, and methods referenced symbolically from a type's constant pool, and replacing those **symbolic references** with **direct references**.
- **[Type safety]({% link _java/glossary/type-safety.md %})** means that programs are allowed to manipulate the memory occupied by an object's instance variables on the heap only in ways that are defined by that object's class.
- **JPLIS** stands for **Java Programming Language Instrumentation Services**.
- **JVM TI**: **Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface**
- **resolve**: The process of loading all the classes that a given class depends on is called **resolving** the class.
