The Servlet API comes in four Java packages. The packages are as follows.

- `javax.servlet`. Contains classes and interfaces that define the contract
  between **a servlet** and **a servlet container**.
- `javax.servlet.http`. Contains classes and interfaces that
  define the contract between **an HTTP servlet** and **a servlet container**.
- `javax.servlet.annotation`. Contains annotations to annotate servlets, filters, and listeners.
  It also specifies metadata for annotated components.
- `javax.servlet.descriptor`. Contains types that provide programmatic access to
  a web application's configuration information.

This article focuses on members of `javax.servlet` and `javax.servlet.http`.
