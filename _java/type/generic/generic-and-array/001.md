## type parameter array

An array needs to know its type when it is created,
so that it can perform a check at runtime when an element is stored in it
to make sure that the element is assignment compatible with the array type.

An array's type information will not be available at runtime
if you use a type parameter to create the array.
This is the reason that the statement is not allowed.

```java
public class HelloWorld<T> {
    private T[] elements;

    public HelloWorld(int howMany) {
        // A compile-time error
        elements = new T[howMany];
    }
}
```

### generic type array

You cannot create an array of a generic type
because the compiler cannot ensure the type-safety of the assignment to the array element.
You cannot write the following code:

```text
public class HelloWorld {
    public void test() {
        Wrapper<String>[] gsArray = null;

        // Cannot create an array of generic type
        gsArray = new Wrapper<String>[10]; // A compile-time error
    }
}
```

It is allowed to create an array of unbounded wildcard generic types, as shown:

```text
public class HelloWorld {
    public void test() {
        Wrapper<?>[] anotherArray = new Wrapper<?>[10]; // Ok
    }
}
```

## Reflection

Suppose you want to use an array of a generic type.
You can do so by using the `newInstance()` method of the `java.lang.reflect.Array` class as follows.

You will have to deal with the unchecked warnings at compile time
because of the cast used in the array creation statement.

The following snippet of code shows that you can still bypass the **compile-time type-safety check**
when you try to sneak in an `Object` into an array of `Wrapper<String>`.
However, this is the consequence you have to live with when using generics,
which does not carry its type information at runtime.
Java generics are as skin-deep as you can imagine.

```java
import java.lang.reflect.Array;

public class HelloWorld {
    public void test() {
        Wrapper<String>[] a = (Wrapper<String>[]) Array.newInstance(Wrapper.class, 10);
        Object[] objArray = (Object[]) a;

        objArray[0] = new Object();// <- Will throw a java.lang.ArrayStoreExceptionxception

        a[0] = new Wrapper<String>("Hello");// <- OK. Checked by compiler
    }
}
```
