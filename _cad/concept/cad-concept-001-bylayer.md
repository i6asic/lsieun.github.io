Assigning Colors, Linetypes, and Linetype Scales to Individual Objects

If you prefer, you can set up Autocad to assign specific colors and linetypes to objects
instead of having objects take on the color and linetype settings of the layer on which they reside.
Normally, objects are given a default color and linetype called `ByLayer`,
which means each object takes on the color or linetype of its assigned layer.
