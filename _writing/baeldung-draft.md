## how to research an article

- you'll notice that most topics point to a link - usually a StackOverflow link - to get you started
- to be clear - that is **not enough** and the article should not just be based on that source
- the link is just a starting point - you **need to do your own research**, beyond that article, as you write

## extra info about the structure of an article

- the article should be focused on the main topic, and try to avoid unnecessary details
- for certain parts of the article you can include links to other articles that discuss that, if it's something that would detract from the main topic

## starting with an outline

- note that it's a good idea to start with a quick outline, before actually starting to work on the article
- that generally helps make sure you're on the same page with your editor - in the way you see the article
- that helps keep changes to a minimum - later, when the draft is ready

- however, be aware that an outline is only a starting point; as you write, you may still make changes that don't 100% match the initial outline
- your editor can also suggest these kinds of changes as well


## GitHub code link at the end

- at the end of the article, we need to have a link to the GitHub project
- the format of this link should be **exactly like this**:
- example: "... available [over on GitHub](http://thelink.com)."

### the readability score

- the Yoast SEO plugin provides a Readability score for each article
- this can be found right below the text
- ideally, this should be "Good" or at least "OK"

- however, the plugin is limited given that our articles contain code blocks and technical terms
- the plugin is not able to exclude the code blocks from its analysis
- so, it may not always be possible to bring the score up to "Good"

- the main benefit of using this plugin is checking the suggestions it provides and applying them as much as possible; things like "too much passive voice" or "too long paragraphs" are usually accurate
