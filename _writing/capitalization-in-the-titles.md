According to most style guides, **nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs** are capitalized in titles of books, articles, and songs.
You'd also capitalize the first word and (according to most guides) the last word of a title, regardless of what part of speech they are. 

**A few parts of speech tend to be lowercase**. For instance, **articles** (`the`, `an`, and `a`) are lowercase.

Some **conjunctions** (e.g., `but`, `yet`) and **prepositions** (e.g., `over`, `through`) are capitalized, and sometimes some are lowercased—it depends on the style guide you follow.
For instance, in AP style title case, prepositions of four letters or more are capitalized.
But in Chicago-style title case, all prepositions are lowercase, no matter their length.
(We explain this more below.)
When in doubt, look up the rules of the style guide you're choosing to follow to know exactly how to style a title.

## Articles

All major style guides are aligned on **articles**, which agree that **articles are lowercase in titles** unless they're one of the first and last words:


<ul>
    <li><b>Incorrect</b>: Ernest Hemingway wrote For Whom <span style="color:red;">The</span> Bell Tolls.</li>
    <li><b>Correct</b>: Ernest Hemingway wrote For Whom <span style="color:blue;">the</span> Bell Tolls.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><b>Incorrect</b>: Girl on <span style="color:red;">A</span> Train is a thriller by A. J. Waines.</li>
    <li><b>Correct</b>: Girl on <span style="color:blue;">a</span> Train is a thriller by A. J. Waines.</li>
</ul>

In each of these titles, **the** and **a** are not capitalized because they are articles.

In this next example, the first article, **a**, is capitalized because it's the first word,
but **the** is lowercase because it is an article that is not a first or last word:

<ul>
    <li><b>Incorrect</b>: Jennifer Egan wrote <i><span style="color:blue;">A</span> Visit from <span style="color:red;">The</span> Goon Squad</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Correct</b>: Jennifer Egan wrote <i><span style="color:blue;">A</span> Visit from <span style="color:blue;">the</span> Goon Squad.</i></li>
</ul>

## Conjunctions

**Conjunctions** are words that link other words, phrases, or clauses together.
Style guides differ here on whether to capitalize or lowercase certain conjunctions.
For instance, according to **AP style**, **conjunctions of three letters or fewer are lowercase**.
However, **Chicago style** prefers to **lowercase all coordinating conjunctions** except for `yet` and `so` and lowercases the subordinating conjunction `as` but capitalizes `if`.
(Again, it's best to look up the rule if you're unsure about your specific title.)

The examples below illustrate both AP and Chicago rules for conjunctions:

<ul>
    <li><b>Incorrect</b>: She titled her thesis "Urban Legends: Fact <span style="color:red;">Or</span> Fiction?"</li>
    <li><b>Correct</b>: She titled her thesis "Urban Legends: Fact <span style="color:blue;">or</span> Fiction?"</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><b>Incorrect</b>: Shakespeare wrote Romeo <span style="color:red;">And</span> Juliet.</li>
    <li><b>Correct</b>: Shakespeare wrote Romeo <span style="color:blue;">and</span> Juliet.</li>
</ul>

## Nouns

Style guides agree that **nouns should always be capitalized**.

<ul>
    <li><b>Incorrect</b>: The <span style="color:red;">lion</span>, the <span style="color:red;">witch</span> and the <span style="color:red;">wardrobe</span> is by C. S. Lewis.</li>
    <li><b>Correct</b>: The <span style="color:blue;">Lion</span>, the <span style="color:blue;">Witch</span> and the <span style="color:blue;">Wardrobe</span> is by C. S. Lewis.</li>
</ul>

## Verbs

**Verbs are also always capitalized**, according to all style guides.

<ul>
    <li><b>Incorrect</b>: Things <span style="color:red;">fall</span> Apart is by Chinua Achebe.</li>
    <li><b>Correct</b>: Things <span style="color:blue;">Fall</span> Apart is by Chinua Achebe.</li>
</ul>

## Adjectives

**Adjectives are always capitalized**.

<ul>
    <li><b>Incorrect</b>: Roald Dahl wrote Charlie and the <span style="color:red;">chocolate</span> Factory.</li>
    <li><b>Correct</b>: Roald Dahl wrote Charlie and the <span style="color:blue;">Chocolate</span> Factory.</li>
</ul>

## Adverbs

**Adverbs are also always capitalized**.

<ul>
    <li><b>Incorrect</b>: Brené Brown wrote Daring <span style="color:red;">greatly</span>: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead.</li>
    <li><b>Correct</b>: Brené Brown wrote Daring <span style="color:blue;">Greatly</span>: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead.</li>
</ul>

## Prepositions

**Knowing whether to capitalize prepositions also depends on what style guide you follow**.

- In AP title case, prepositions of four or more letters (such as between, above, and below) should be capitalized.
- However, the Chicago Manual of Style says to lowercase all prepositions, regardless of their length. When following Chicago Style, watch out for how you're using a preposition in a title—it might not necessarily function as a preposition. You can capitalize a preposition when it is "used adverbially or adjectivally (**up** in **Look Up**, **down** in **Turn Down**)," the Chicago Manual of Style says.

So if you were writing the following title of this novella, you would write it this way, according to Chicago style:

<ul>
    <li>Norman Maclean wrote A River Runs <span style="color:blue;">through</span> It.</li>
</ul>

But if you were following AP style, you would write it this way:

<ul>
    <li>Norman Maclean wrote A River Runs <span style="color:blue;">Through</span> It.</li>
</ul>

## More examples of capitalization in titles

Consider these additional examples of correctly capitalized titles (which meet the criteria in any style guide) to help guide you:

<ul>
    <li><i>East of Eden</i> was a popular book by John Steinbeck.</li>
    <li><i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i>, by Neil Gaiman, is my favorite book.</li>
    <li>The first movie of the series is <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>.</li>
    <li>The sitcom <i>Two and a Half Men</i> explores the lives of two brothers.</li>
</ul>

The same rule regarding title capitalization applies to subtitles. See the examples below:

<ul>
    <li>The Assassin's Cloak: An Anthology of the World's Greatest Diarists</li>
    <li>Virginia Woolf wrote Orlando: A Biography.</li>
</ul>

In these particular examples, the articles "**an**" and "**a**" are capitalized because they are both the first word of the subtitle.
