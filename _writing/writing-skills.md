Writing skills are an important part of communication.
Good writing skills allow you to communicate your message with clarity and ease to a far larger audience than through face-to-face or telephone conversations.

Today, when anyone can be their own publisher, we see more and more examples of poor writing skills both in print and on the web.
Poor writing skills create poor first impressions and many readers will have an immediate negative reaction if they spot a spelling or grammatical mistake.
As just one example, a spelling mistake on a commercial web page may cause potential customers to doubt the credibility of the website and the organisation.

To improve writing is just a matter of becoming conscious of the things you can do to give your text more structure and make your copy crisp and readable with a conversational style.

### Grammar, Spelling and Punctuation

Correct [grammar](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/write/grammar1.html), [punctuation](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/write/punctuation1.html) and [spelling](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/write/spelling.html) are key in written communications.
The reader will form an opinion of you, the author, based on both the content and presentation, and errors are likely to lead them to form a negative impression.

### Give Your Writing Structure

It's fine to rattle off a stream of consciousness when you're writing in your journal, but if you actually want to communicate with others you'll need to bring some order to those rambling thoughts. Here are some tips.

- Make sure you're clear on the concepts you're writing about.
- If the message is complex, outline it.
- Anticipate your readers' questions.
- Don't over-explain everything.

### Tighten Your Writing

We sometimes write like we talk, and that can be a good thing.
It keeps our writing conversational (more on that in a moment.)
But rambling, wordy writing makes your text hard to read, and it can make you sound as though you lack conviction.
Start practicing these tips to improve your writing skills.

- Eliminate the filler words and phrases

### Make Your Writing More Conversational

- Stick with simple words.
- Try transcribing yourself.

Record yourself talking. You can learn a lot about conversational writing using this one weird trick!

- Keep your sentences simple.

Short, less complicated sentences are easier to read. Keep it simple, silly! But do vary your sentence length so your writing has a nice flow.

- Infuse your personality into your writing

Letting your personality shine through is the best way to develop a writing style. Use the phrases and slang that you would normally use (within reason). When it's appropriate, throw in a relevant personal anecdote. In all but the most formal or professional writing settings, be yourself when you write.

- Practice, practice, practice!

The ultimate way to improving writing is to learn what weakens it in the first place, and then set your mind to fixing (and eventually preventing) the glitches. The more you write, edit, and proofread, the better you get at it.
