### Model

In English, a sentence begins with a capital letter. That's an upper case letter.

As we write sentences, we're either making a statement or asking a question. If we're asking a question, we must end with **a question mark**. That's called an **interrogative sentence**. If you're simply making a statement, the sentense ends with **a period**. That's called a **declarative sentence**.

If you're giving a command, and it's an urgent command, a strong command, you can end with an **exclamation point**. We use exclamation points to express strong emotions or some kind of urgent message.

Punctuation makes the purpose of each sentence clear.

## Punctuation marks

- Comma `,`
  - in complex sentences
  - int compound sentences
  - after introductory words or phrases
  - to separated names of people you address
- Capital letter `Aa`
  - first person singular pronoun
  - proper nouns

To understand what kinds of sentences are possible, you must know the word **clause**.
