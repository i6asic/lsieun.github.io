## the lifecycle of an article

Any article (or Jira issue) goes through these states that correspond to the JIRA statutes:

- **Open** - the Jira is in **To Do** and **unassigned**
- **In Progress** - you're working on the issue
- **Editor Review** - your editor is reviewing the content and providing feedback; the Jira will go back to In Progress if there are any changes required
- **Senior Editor Review** - once the editor is happy with the content, they will ping a Senior Editor to do a final review; the Jira remains in **Editor Review** state
- **Published** - once the Senior Editor gives the "go-live" signal, the editor will move the draft to the live site, and ping the person who does the publishing; they will post the live URL and close the Jira as Done

## mini-article vs article

- when we create a topic on Jira, we do that as **a mini-article** or **a full article**
- keep in mind that's our best guess, not something set in stone
- your goal should be to cover the topic well
- if that means it goes over our **mini-article** definition - that's absolutely fine
- and if it turns out to be super small and not really a full article (<750 words) - that's fine as well
- the point is - we can easily convert between **mini-article** and **article** - as we need to

## max article length

- if you notice that the article is going to be longer than the typical **1500 word** write-up, please make sure you let your editor know about that

## target word count

- some Jira issues will have a target word count in the description; this is a rough guideline based on similar articles, but not a strict limit
- the main goal is always to cover the topic adequately

## using images

- if you use an image or diagram from a different source, this should include credit and link to the source;
  example: "This image is part of the official documentation for Mesos
  ([source](https://mesos.apache.org/assets/img/documentation/architecture3.jpg))."
  in the article: https://www.baeldung.com/apache-mesos

- if you create an image or diagram for the article, attach the editable source to the Jira as well
