What is cloud native?

Cloud native is the name for **an approach** to building and running applications
across private, public, and hybrid clouds.
When an app is "cloud native," it's designed specifically to be developed and managed within a cloud environment.

Companies are increasingly using cloud native development,
so they can accelerate application delivery, get to market faster,
and meet customer expectations for speed and agility.

What is cloud native?

Cloud native refers less to **where an application resides** and more to **how it is built and deployed**.

- A **cloud native application** consists of discrete, reusable components known as **microservices**
  that are designed to integrate into any cloud environment.
- These **microservices** act as building blocks and are often packaged in containers.
- Microservices work together as a whole to comprise an application, yet each can be independently scaled,
  continuously improved, and quickly iterated through automation and orchestration processes.
- The flexibility of each microservice adds to the agility and continuous improvement of cloud-native applications.

> 根据上面的描述来看，cloud native application也是由microservices构成的。
