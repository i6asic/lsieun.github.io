The Microsoft Program Maintenance Utility (`NMAKE.EXE`) is a command-line tool included with Visual Studio.
It builds projects based on commands that are contained in a description file, usually called a **makefile**.

`NMAKE` must run in a Developer Command Prompt window.
A Developer Command Prompt window has the environment variables set for the tools, libraries,
and include file paths required to build at the command line.
For details on how to open a Developer Command Prompt window, see Use the MSVC toolset from the command line.
