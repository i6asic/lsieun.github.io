If you use **the 64-bit version of Windows**,
you may have noticed that there is a folder called `SysWOW64` on your hard drive.
Then do you know what the `SysWOW64` folder is?

In general, the `SysWOW64` folder is a subsystem of the Windows operating system
capable of running 32-bit applications on 64-bit Windows.
So, in the beginning, we will begin to explain the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems.

## 32-bit VS. 64-bit

### 处理数据的能力-本质

The terms of 32-bit and 64-bit usually refer to the way computer processor handles information.
In general, the 64-bit version of Windows handles more random access memory than a 32-bit system.

本质上是CPU的能力，会进一步延伸到硬件（Hardware）和软件（Software）层面

### 内存空间-硬件层面

The 32-bit version system is limited to 4GB, but only around 3GB RAM can be used.
However, the 64-bit version system can hold more RAM, and allows you to use more RAM effectively.

### 兼容性-软件层面

Another big feature of a 32-bit and 64-bit system is software compatibility.
Both 32-bit and 64-bit software can be run on a 64-bit version system,
while 32-bit programs can only be on 32-bit Windows systems.

## 两个文件夹的区别

Referring to the 32-bit and 64-bit version,
there will be two associated folders,
which are `System32` and `SysWOW64`.
`System32` is a very important part of every Windows version since Windows 2000 and
it is located at `C:\Windows\System32` that stores all critical and vital files to keep Windows running properly.
The `System32` folder is for 64-bit files.

The `SysWOW64` folder is located on `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`.
It is a legitimate folder filled with system files used to make the use of 32-bit programs on Windows 64-bit version possible.
This process goes along with `System32` Microsoft Windows directory which is responsible for managing 64-bit files.

Besides, `WoW64` stands for **Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit** -
a subsystem of the Windows operating system capable of running 32-bit applications
that are included in all 64-bit versions of Windows.
`SysWOW64` aims to take care of many of the differences between 32-bit Windows and 64-bit Windows systems,
particularly involving structural changes to Windows itself.
