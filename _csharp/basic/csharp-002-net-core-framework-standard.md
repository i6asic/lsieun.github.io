**.Net Framework** and **.Net Core** are the two different implementations of **.Net Runtime**.

**.Net Core** is newer than **.Net Framework**.

**.Net Framework** is a framework for building and managing the Windows and Web-based application like Asp.Net or Asp.Net MVC application.
This is old framework created by Microsoft and provides end to end solution.
This does not support cross-platform deployment.

**.Net Core** is a cross-platform and open source framework for building the application
which can run on any platform like Mac, Linux or Windows.
It is also created by Microsoft.
It is not a new version on .Net Framework, whereas it is a totally new framework which is written from scratch.

**.Net Standard** is a specification that can be used across all .NET implementations.
It is used for developing library projects only.
This means if we are creating a library in **.NET Standard**, we can use those in **.NET Framework** and **.NET Core**.
