title: "LINQ to Objects"
sequence: "101"
---

Regardless of the type of application you are creating using the .NET platform,
your program will certainly need to access some form of data as it executes.
To be sure, data can be found in numerous locations,
including XML files, relational databases, in-memory collections, and primitive arrays.
Historically speaking, based on the location of said data,
programmers needed to make use of different and unrelated APIs.
The Language Integrated Query (LINQ) technology set, introduced initially in .NET 3.5, provides a concise,
symmetrical, and strongly typed manner to access a wide variety of data stores.

Before you dive into LINQ to Objects proper,
the first part of this chapter quickly reviews the key C# programming constructs that enable LINQ.
As you work through this chapter, you will find that
**implicitly typed local variables**, **object initialization syntax**, **lambda expressions**, **extension methods**,
and **anonymous types** will be quite useful (if not occasionally mandatory).
